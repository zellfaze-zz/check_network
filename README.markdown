#Network Checker

This software sends a single ICMP ping request to 8.8.8.8 and outputs the
amount of time it took for the round trip.

It is designed to be used in XFCE's panel.

##Installation

Download the executable from /bin/Release (or build it yourself) and place it
somewhere on your computer.

On your XFCE panel add a new Launcher item.  Have this launcher button run
`check_network -t`. Now next to the Launcher item create a new Generic Monitor
item on your panel.  This should be set to run `check_network` every 5 seconds.

You should now be able to toggle the ping monitor on and off.
